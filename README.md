# AWS CloudFront Purger

You can use AWS CloudFront as a reverse proxy in front of your whole Drupal site.

This module provides a **very simple** AWS CloudFront [Purge][1] **Purger** plugin.

## Required Modules

Because AWS CloudFront does not support cache tags (yet), this module depends on [URLs queuer][2] module

## Installation

This module requires you to have the AWS SDK loaded in your classpath.

The recommended approach is to have a composer file in your project root, and run:

```
composer require aws/aws-sdk-php:~3.0
```

## Configuration

You need to specify the Distribution ID in your settings.php.

```
$config['cloudfront_purger.settings']['distribution_id'] = 'ABCD1234';
```
Alternatively, you can use drush to set it, then export as part of your site configuration.

```
drush config-set cloudfront_purger.settings distribution_id ABCD1234
```

### Overriding AWS CloudFront region.

You can override the CloudFront client region by adding the following to your sites services.yml file:

```
parameters:
  cloudfront.cloudfront_client.options:
    region: us-east-1
    version: latest
```

## AWS Authentication

This module does not require setting AWS access keys, and assumes you are following best practices and
following the SDK Guide on [Credentials][3]

This means, either using:

- IAM Roles
- Exporting credentials using environment variables
- Using a profile in a ~/.aws/credentials file

You will need to allow the `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation` action in your IAM policy.
